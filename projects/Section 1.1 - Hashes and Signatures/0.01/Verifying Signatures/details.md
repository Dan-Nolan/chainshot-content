**Recovering an Ethereum Address**

Given a message and a signature, you can get the Ethereum address of the person who signed the message as follows: https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/18105/how-does-recovering-the-public-key-from-an-ecdsa-signature-work?noredirect=1&lq=1

Again, for more info on the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), (**not** for the light of heart), we'd suggest this [tutorial by Jimmy Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6voIwB-An4) (est. completion time **~3 hours**). He discusses the ECDSA signature algorithm and the verification algorithm at the 1:00:00 mark and 1:01:00:

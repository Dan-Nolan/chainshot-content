## Using Keccak-256

Complete the `toHash` function.

You should be able to pass in some data to the function and it should return the `keccak256` hash of that data. See **Details** to learn more about the `keccak256` hash function.

Hint: Use `EthCrypto.hash.keccak256`. See the [eth-crypto documentation](https://github.com/pubkey/eth-crypto).

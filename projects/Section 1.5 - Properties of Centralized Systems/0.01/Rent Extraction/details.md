## More on Rent Extraction

Many systems have what are called [**network effects**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect), meaning the more people there are in a system, the more valuable the system is to everyone. For example, a central payment operator with only 10 users is not very useful to any of those 10 users, since none of the people they want to transact with are in that system. But, a central payment operator that everyone uses is much more valuable to all of its users. If all of your friends use Venmo, then it's more useful to you than some other payments app.

When a system or company has established a large network of users, they can extract rent, increasing fees, ads, and the like. Think to yourself: Right now, Venmo is free to send transactions, but what if they added fees of $.001 per transaction?

## Fault Tolerance

Fault Tolerance is a worry for architecturally centralized systems (e.g. a system with a single database and server). However, it's important to note that many of the systems that we might call "centralized" are architecturally decentralized (e.g. they have multiple databases and servers around the world) and are thus fault tolerant. For examples of fault tolerant centralized systems, see the **Details** tab. 
Here, we've implemented `FT_Paypal.js` an example of how we could make or central payment processor fault tolerant.
